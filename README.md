## Get Started

### Data Sources

The dataset utilized in this project was meticulously scraped from the Google Play website. Unlike the Apple App Store, which boasts several popular datasets, Google Play Store datasets are relatively scarce. The scarcity can be attributed to the greater complexity of scraping data from Google Play compared to its Apple counterpart. The project incorporates two key data files:

1. **apps.csv**: This file serves as a repository of information on Google Play applications. It encompasses 13 distinct features, each offering insights into the characteristics and attributes of an app.
   
2. **user_reviews.csv**: Comprising a treasure trove of user reviews, this file contains 100 reviews for each app, meticulously sorted in descending order of helpfulness. Each review has undergone preprocessing and is enriched with three essential attributes: Sentiment (categorized as Positive, Negative, or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity, and Sentiment Subjectivity.

## Project Tasks
   
1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the dataset is free of inconsistencies and errors, making it ready for analysis.

2. **Exploring App Categories**: Delving into the diverse app categories available in the Google Play Store and understanding their distribution.

3. **Distribution of App Ratings**: Analyzing the distribution of app ratings to gain insights into user sentiment and preferences.

4. **Size and Price of an App**: Investigating the relationship between the size and price of apps.

5. **Relation Between App Category and App Price**: Examining how app categories correlate with their pricing.

6. **Filter Out "Junk" Apps**: Identifying and filtering out low-quality or irrelevant apps.

7. **Popularity of Paid Apps vs. Free Apps**: Comparing the popularity and user engagement of paid apps versus free apps.

8. **Sentiment Analysis of User Reviews**: Utilizing sentiment analysis techniques to extract insights from user reviews and gauge user satisfaction.
